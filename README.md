# Vim configuration

This is my personal vim configuration, as a computer science student.

## Content
- .vimrc file
- an executable which :
    - creates the arborescence
    - creates the .vimrc file
    - creates the templates files
    - installs the theme
    - installs the plugin manager (Plug)
    - installs the plugins (see list below)

## Plugins
- NERDTree : displays the current arborescence and allows to navigate it.
- airline (and themes) : displays a status bar at the bottom of the buffer.
- auto-pairs : automatically creates/deletes matching (, {, [, "...
- vim-rainbow : changes the colors of matching parentheses, only turned on for .scm files.

## Themes
- I use the vim-colors-xcode theme.

## Requirements
Make sur that **git** and **curl** are installed.
