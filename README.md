# Vim configuration

This is my personal vim configuration, as a computer science student.

## Content
- A vimrc file
- An executable which :
    - creates the arborescence
    - creates the .vimrc file
    - creates the templates files
    - installs the theme
    - installs the plugin manager (Plug)
    - installs the plugins (see list below)

## Plugins
- [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) : displays the current arborescence and allows to navigate it.
- [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) (and themes) : displays a status bar at the bottom of the buffer.
- [auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) : automatically creates/deletes matching (, {, [, "...
- [vim-rainbow](https://github.com/frazrepo/vim-rainbow) : changes the colors of matching parentheses, only turned on for .scm files.

## Themes
- I use the [vim-colors-xcode](https://github.com/lunacookies/vim-colors-xcode) theme.

## Requirements
Make sure that **git** and **curl** are installed.
